                <p>
                    One of the integral parts to life within UCLA and UCLA Engineering
                    is participation in student groups/organizations. There are over 30
                    student groups, and several hundred students help serve and lead these groups.
                    Each student group has its own demographics and purposes. However, all
                    of them combine to provide the best possible experience for every
                    student here at UCLA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Student organizations present a unique opportunity for students because
                    they are entirely student run with only advisory support from faculty.
                    As a result, many of the activities hosted by student organizations are
                    created from the standpoint of a student rather than the school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They range in size and purpose: from a few individuals to several hundred,
                    from community service engineering groups to honor societies. No matter your
                    interest or personality, there is a student organization that would love to
                    have you!

                <p>
                    With a lot of coursework and plenty of other activities available on
                    campus, participating in student organizations may appear to be the last
                    thing on your mind. However, participating in student organizations 
                    provide many benefits at the same time. They include:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diversified experience to put on your resume</li>
                        <li>Creation of a network of talented individuals</li>
                        <li>Opportunities to meet with companies</li>
                        <li>Change to improve UCLA Engineering</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Throughout the entire nation, students are earning engineering degrees
                    from several great universities. With their education, they are qualified
                    to solve almost any technical issue thrown at them. As a result, many 
                    companies are beginning to look at the non-technical skill sets of their
                    candidates, which aren't usually taught in a classroom. That is where participation
                    in student organizations can be highly beneficial. They provide the chance
                    to develop skills such as public speaking, management, and teamwork that
                    are just as necessary to succeed in the real world. Furthermore, companies
                    understand the talent found in student organization leadership and go to them
                    first for talent. So find one that fits your desires and try it out!
